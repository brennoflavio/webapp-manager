# Webapp Manager

Run websites as if they were apps.

This is a fork of [Linux Mint's webapp manager](https://github.com/linuxmint/webapp-manager) that uses [Nativefier](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier) to bundle webpages as Electron Apps, integrating them with your system.

To use this app, install a recent NodeJS version (>=12.9) and Nativefier with:

```
sudo npm install -g nativefier
```
